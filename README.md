## Description

Fully dynamic material library folder scanning and generation system. texture dependence viewer as well as live metadata viewing and editing. 

## Getting Started

### Installing

This plugin is a self contained Unreal Engine 5.3 plugin. Place the **Entire folder into either your Project/Plugins folder (if Plugins does not exist you can create it) or place it in your engine installation directory under Engine/Plugins

### Loading the interface

* Open your Unreal Engine project
* Navigate to the main editor toolbar and find the palette button (Hovering over this helpfully tells you Open the Material Vault Library Interface.)

## Help

Displacement is currently disabled for this initial release. It is in active development but until a future UE version is released that does not involve eidting the config files I do not think it's best to implement displacement at this early stage. 

Metadata is 95% working. Some kinks to iron out with Author and Modified Date.

The release section has the latest large files that conventional Git would remove as they are >100MB. Download these and place them in the 

\Plugins\MaterialVault\MaterialVault\Content\MaterialVault\Textures\Normals folder
